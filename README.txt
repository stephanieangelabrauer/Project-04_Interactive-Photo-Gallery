# Project-04_Interactive-Photo-Gallery

In this project, I have created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. At the top of the page you will find a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There are back and previous arrows to cycle through photos.

Using the supplied mockup files of the online technology school Teamtreehouse where I am enrolled as Techdegree Student in Front End Web Development, I built a mobile and desktop version of the interactive photo gallery using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.
